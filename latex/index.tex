lib\+Clarion\+Trinity is a C++ library designed to help processing data from the CLARION2 and TRINITY HPGe and charged-\/particle arrays. It is designed to interface with \href{https://github.com/belmakier/libpixie}{\texttt{ libpixie}}, which handles the raw data format and event-\/building. lib\+Clarion\+Trinity processes the libpixie events into detectors and groups of detectors -\/ doing BGO supression, Clover addback, requiring both signals from a single GAGG crystal etc. etc.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md0}
Installation is simple, you\textquotesingle{}ll just need to get the source code and compile to get going. First clone the repository using


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/belmakier/libClarionTrinity.git}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then change directory and make some build directories\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd libpixie;}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir lib;}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir obj;}

\end{DoxyCode}


Change directory again and compile


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd src}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}

\end{DoxyCode}


The install directories are specified in the Makefile, by default they are {\ttfamily \$\+HOME/.local/include} for headers and {\ttfamily \$\+HOME/.local/lib} for dynamic libraries. If these don\textquotesingle{}t exist you\textquotesingle{}ll need to create them. After that, you can install with


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make install}

\end{DoxyCode}


Make sure the {\ttfamily \$\+HOME/.local/lib} directory is in your {\ttfamily \$\+LD\+\_\+\+LIBRARY\+\_\+\+PATH}, and you\textquotesingle{}re good to go!\hypertarget{index_authors}{}\doxysection{Developers}\label{index_authors}
